Have you ever searched for stuff to execute on a school-pc?
Here's a database with stuff for it!
Ill add some stuff like black-screen links, explorer-spam and explorer-kill. Lots of cool files to execute!
# How to execute .bat
If you want to execute .bat files, but cmd is disabled, you can do it by creating a shortcut, and typing 

"%windir%\System32\cmd.exe" /c call <scriptname>.bat

That is probably going to work.
